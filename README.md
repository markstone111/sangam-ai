#üåü About the Project: SangamAI
##üí° Inspiration
Thalassemia remains a major public health challenge in India, especially due to the lack of awareness, irregular blood donations, and limited access to specialized care. We were deeply moved by the story and mission of Blood Warriors and their commitment to eliminating Thalassemia by 2035. The idea of using AI to solve a real-world, life-threatening issue resonated strongly with us. This project was inspired by the desire to create technology with compassion‚Äîbridging gaps in access, connection, and care.

## üìö What We Learned
Through this journey, we explored:

The complexity of managing Thalassemia as a chronic condition.

How blood donation systems like e-RaktKosh operate.

AI techniques for predictive analytics, matching algorithms, and natural language processing.

Ethical implications and importance of data privacy in healthcare applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It
We designed SangamAI as a modular AI-driven solution focusing on:

Predictive Donor Availability: Using time-series data and donor history to forecast likely donors using machine learning.

Real-time Matching Engine: Matching patients with eligible donors based on location, blood type, and donation patterns.

Care & Support Portal: Facilitating secure patient-provider communication and sending AI-curated health tips.

Gamified Engagement: Encouraging recurring donations through impact tracking and community rewards.

We modeled components using Python (with libraries like scikit-learn and pandas) and designed mock user interfaces with Figma for visualization. APIs were conceptualized for integration with existing platforms like e-RaktKosh.



## Inspiration
Thalassemia remains one of India's most under-addressed genetic disorders, despite being preventable and manageable with timely care and regular blood transfusions. What inspired us most was the work of Blood Warriors, who are not only advocating for awareness but also working tirelessly to build infrastructure for care. We wanted to contribute to their mission using AI, a tool we believe can close the gap between need and access‚Äîparticularly in rural or underserved areas.

## What it does
Predicts donor availability using past donation data and behavioral patterns.
Matches patients with compatible donors in real-time based on proximity, urgency, and blood type.
Integrates with existing systems like e-RaktKosh and Blood Bridge.
Facilitates secure communication between patients and healthcare providers.
Raises awareness and encourages recurring donations through a gamified impact dashboard.

## How we built it
Predictive Modeling: Implemented a time-series based donor availability model using scikit-learn.
Matching Algorithm: Built logic to prioritize donor-patient connections using location, blood type, and urgency.
Design & Mockups: Created a Figma prototype to visualize user flows for patients, donors, and hospitals.
Security Framework: Designed a data handling structure ensuring encryption and compliance with privacy standards.
Integration Layer: Mapped potential APIs to connect with public systems like e-RaktKosh and NGO initiatives.

## Challenges we ran into
Data Access: Working with hypothetical or incomplete data made building realistic models more difficult.
Privacy & Ethics: Designing secure systems for sensitive health data required careful planning and compliance considerations.
System Integration: Mapping SangamAI‚Äôs features to existing public health infrastructure required research and thoughtful API design.
Scalability: Ensuring the model remains effective at national scale with diverse user bases posed algorithmic challenges.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Developed a solution rooted in empathy, designed to make a real-world impact.
Created a predictive model that enhances donor reliability.
Built an intuitive interface to promote recurring blood donations and patient support.
Ensured the solution aligns with existing national health systems.

## What we learned
A deeper understanding of Thalassemia and the urgent needs of patients.
Practical experience in applying AI to health tech, including modeling, privacy, and ethical design.
How to ideate under constraints and design user-first systems that are scalable and sustainable.
The power of community-driven healthcare solutions when supported by technology.

## What's next for SangamAI
Pilot Testing: Partner with NGOs like Blood Warriors to test our prototype in a real-world setting.
Data Partnership: Seek anonymized datasets to train and validate models more effectively.
Mobile App Development: Build out Android/iOS versions for greater accessibility.
AI Optimization: Improve donor prediction accuracy using neural networks or reinforcement learning.
Policy Advocacy: Work with stakeholders to integrate SangamAI into public healthcare infrastructure.
